At Maryam Studio, we view challenging behaviors not as problems to be stopped, but as messages to be understood. Our Behavioral Therapy program, rooted in the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), focuses on replacing maladaptive behaviors with positive, functional alternatives.</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Understanding ABA</h3>\n            <p>Applied Behavior Analysis is the gold standard for autism treatment. It involves analyzing the antecedents (what happens before) and consequences (what happens after) of a behavior to understand <em>why</em> it is happening. We then modify the environment and interactions to support positive change.</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Our Methodology</h3>\n            <div class=\"check-list style-4\">\n                 <ul>\n                    <li><strong>Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA):</strong> We start by collecting data to pinpoint the triggers and functions of specific behaviors.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Positive Reinforcement:</strong> We focus heavily on rewarding desired behaviors (like asking for help instead of screaming) to increase their frequency.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Skill Acquisition:</strong> Breaking down complex skills (like washing hands) into small, teachable steps (chaining).</li>\n                    <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Ensuring that skills learned in therapy are applied at home, at school, and in the community.</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Addressing Common Challenges</h3>\n            <p>We successfully work with children on issues suchs as:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Self-injurious behaviors</li>\n                <li>Aggression or meltdowns</li>\n                <li>Refusal to follow instructions</li>\n                <li>Transition difficulties</li>\n                <li>Rigidity or repetitive behaviors</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-4\">Our approach is ethical, child-friendly, and always prioritizes the dignity and emotional well-being of the child. We work closely with parents to ensure consistency across environments.</p>\n        "
