Our Full-Day Autism Program is designed to bridge the gap between traditional schooling and clinical therapy, providing a holistic environment where children can thrive, learn, and grow at their own pace.</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Why Choose a Full-Day Program?</h3>\n            <p>Many parents struggle with the logistics of shuffling their child between speech therapy, occupational therapy, and special education classes at different centers. This fragmented approach often leads to burnout for both the child and the parent. Our Full-Day Program solves this by integrating all these essential therapies into a single, cohesive daily schedule (9:00 AM – 4:00 PM).</p>\n            <p>Research consistently shows that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) benefit most from <strong>intensive, early, and consistent intervention</strong>. A full-day schedule allows for over 25+ hours of engagement per week, significantly higher than standard outpatient therapy models.</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Program Highlights & Core Components</h3>\n            \n            <h4 class=\"h4 mt-3\">1. Structured Daily Routine</h4>\n            <p>Children on the autism spectrum thrive on predictability. Our day begins with a sensory-calming morning circle, preparing the child for learning. The schedule is visually structured, helping children understand transitions and reducing anxiety. Activities move from high-focus tasks to sensory breaks, ensuring the child remains regulated.</p>\n\n            <h4 class=\"h4 mt-3\">2. Integrated Therapy Model</h4>\n            <p>In our school, therapy isn't an isolated event; it's a part of life. \n            <br /><strong>Speech Therapy:</strong> Practiced during snack time (requesting food), circle time (singing), and play (peer interaction).\n            <br /><strong>Occupational Therapy:</strong> Integrated into art, writing, and playground activities to build fine and gross motor skills naturally.\n            <br /><strong>Behavioral Therapy (ABA):</strong> Principles of positive reinforcement are used throughout the day to encourage desirable behaviors and reduce challenging ones.</p>\n\n            <h4 class=\"h4 mt-3\">3. Individualized Education Plan (IEP)</h4>\n            <p>No two children are alike. Upon enrollment, our multi-disciplinary team conducts a comprehensive assessment to create a customized IEP. This plan outlines specific goals in communication, academics, social skills, and daily living. We track data daily and review progress monthly with parents.</p>\n\n            <h4 class=\"h4 mt-3\">4. Social Skills & Peer Interaction</h4>\n            <p>One of the biggest deficits in autism is social communication. In a full-day setting, children have guided opportunities to interact with peers. Our therapists facilitate group games, turn-taking activities, and collaborative play, teaching children how to make friends and read social cues in a safe, supportive environment.</p>\n\n            <h4 class=\"h4 mt-3\">5. Life Skills & Independence</h4>\n            <p>Our goal is to foster independence. We dedicate time to ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) such as toilet training, eating independently, dressing, and personal hygiene. These skills are crucial for a child's long-term dignity and self-sufficiency.</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">A Typical Day at Maryam Studio</h3>\n            <div class=\"check-list style-4 mb-4\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li><strong>09:00 AM:</strong> Arrival & Sensory Integration</li>\n                    <li><strong>09:30 AM:</strong> Morning Circle (Songs, Calendar, Attendance)</li>\n                    <li><strong>10:00 AM:</strong> Academic/Cognitive Session 1 (1:1 focus)</li>\n                    <li><strong>11:00 AM:</strong> Snack Time (Communication focus)</li>\n                    <li><strong>11:30 AM:</strong> Occupational Therapy / Art / Messy Play</li>\n                    <li><strong>12:30 PM:</strong> Lunch (Self-feeding skills) & Social Time</li>\n                    <li><strong>01:30 PM:</strong> Rest & Quiet Time</li>\n                    <li><strong>02:30 PM:</strong> Group Activity / Music / Movement</li>\n                    <li><strong>03:30 PM:</strong> Pack-up & Closing Circle</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Who is this program for?</h3>\n            <p>Our Full-Day Program is ideal for children aged 2 to 12 years who need support with:</p>\n            <div class=\"check-list style-3\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li>Communication delays (verbal or non-verbal)</li>\n                    <li>Sensory processing challenges</li>\n                    <li>Social interaction difficulties</li>\n                    <li>Behavioral regulation</li>\n                    <li>Academic readiness</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-4\"><strong>Join us at Maryam Child Development Studio & Research for Autism.</strong> Together, let's build a foundation for a limitless future.
