For children with autism and developmental delays, difficulties in speaking, understanding, or social interaction can be frustrating. At Maryam Child Development Studio, our Speech Therapy program effectively addresses these challenges, helping children express their wants, needs, thoughts, and feelings with confidence.</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">What is Speech & Language Therapy?</h3>\n            <p>Speech therapy involves the assessment and treatment of communication disorders. It is not just about teaching a child to talk; it is about teaching them to <em>communicate</em>. This includes expanding vocabulary, improving sentence structure, correcting pronunciation (articulation), and enhancing social communication rules (pragmatics).</p>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Our Approach</h3>\n            <p>We use a play-based, child-centered approach. We believe that children learn best when they are engaged and having fun. Our certified speech therapists use evidence-based techniques to target specific goals.</p>\n\n            <h4 class=\"h4 mt-3\">Target Areas:</h4>\n            <div class=\"check-list style-4\">\n                <ul>\n                    <li><strong>Receptive Language:</strong> Improving the understanding of words, instructions, and questions.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Expressive Language:</strong> Encouraging the use of words, gestures, or pictures to express needs and ideas.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Articulation & Phonology:</strong> Correcting sound errors to make speech clearer and more understandable.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Social Pragmatics:</strong> Teaching the rules of conversation, such as eye contact, turn-taking, and staying on topic.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Fluency:</strong> Addressing stuttering or cluttering issues.</li>\n                    <li><strong>Oral Motor Skills:</strong> Strengthening the muscles of the mouth for better speech and feeding.</li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n\n            <h3 class=\"h3 mt-4\">Specialized Techniques</h3>\n            <p>In addition to traditional therapy, we specialize in:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li><strong>AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication):</strong> For non-verbal children, we introduce tools like PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) or communication apps/devices to give them a voice.</li>\n                <li><strong>PROMPT Therapy:</strong> A tactile-kinesthetic approach to help reshape oral movements for speech production.</li>\n                <li><strong>Social Stories:</strong> Using visual narratives to explain social situations and expected responses.</li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p class=\"mt-4\">Our Speech Therapy sessions are tailored to your child's interests, making learning natural and motivating.
